# fpay

Based on https://github.com/cmusatyalab/openface. Created a webapp that uses the webcam to recognise registered users, i.e. register your face once and the webapp will be able to identify you when you come back in the future.

## How to use?
Build the Docker image based on the docker file which hosts a Flask app. Visit the webapp to explore the aforementioned features of the app.

## Future Plans
Train a more robust neural network to have a model that is even more attentive to small details.
